# The Lord of the Rings quote creator.

See the app here: http://lord-of-the-quotes.herokuapp.com/

## Description

With the use of Express, MongoDB, Node and EJS I've created an web app that fetches data from the LOTR API and stores a new quote in MongoDB and renders the update on the page. You can also create your own quote to add the page or delete individual posts. All updates are reflected in the MongoDB cluster.

I wanted to build this application to implement MongoDB in a project. The Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite stories and quote them all the time so this was a fun project to build. I learned how to configure my database in MongoDB with my Express server to properly perform CRUD operations on the application.
